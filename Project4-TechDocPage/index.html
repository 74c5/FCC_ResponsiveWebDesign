            <p>What follows is a lists of commands that I find most useful for everyday use on my linux desktop.</p>
            <p>This is a hardly an exhaustive list of linux CLIs, but rather ones that I notice that I am using often.

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="installing_updates">Installing Updates</header>
            <p>Since switching to an Ubuntu base (from Arch), this is no longer a single command but rather several
                instructions.</p>
            <p>A list of updates can be fetched using:</p>
            <pre><code>$ sudo apt update</code></pre>
            <p>and installed with:</p>
            <code>$ sudo apt upgrade</code>
            <p>Redundant packages can be removed using:</p>
            <code>$ sudo apt autoremove</code>
            <br>
            <p>I also have several flatpak applications installed, so updating also requires:</p>
            <code>$ flatpak update</code>
            <br>
            <p>When I ran an arch based system and used Yay as my Aur helper, I could just use:</p>
            <code>$ yay -Syua</code>
            <p>Of course, this might take just as long since I was would have to re-compile most of my Aur applications.

        <section class="main-section">
            <header id="listing_files">Listing Files</header>
            <p>I use the <code>ls</code> command with the switches <code>als</code> by default, e.g.:</p>
            <pre><code>$ ls -als</code></pre>
            <p>In fact it's muscle memory now. For 95% of my usecases this gives me all the information, I could ever
                want to know about a file.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The switches have the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>-a</code> lists all entries in the folder, even those beginning with <code>.</code> and
                    <code>..</code></li>
                <li><code>-l</code> uses long list format. Each file gets its own line with columns for permissions,
                    ownership and last date of modification.</li>
                <li><code>-s</code> prints the size of the file in blocks</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section">
            <head id="aliasing">Aliasing</head>
            <p>I usually put aliases in or trigger alias creation from the last section of my <code>.bashrc</code> (or similar) file. These alias serve several purposes, namely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abbreviating longer commands making them faster to use and easier to remember.</li>
                <li>Creating shortcut commands for changing to common directories.</li>
                <li>Making commands from my own custom scripts (usually under development) available on the command line. (Yes, it's a bit of a hack, but I prefer it over updating my path.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Examples usecases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I alias mounting of another windows computer at home to a short commmand, I only mount this
                    file system to facilitate backups and so don't need it all the time. I can't use auto mount, since I
                    have to ensure that the other computer is turned on before issuing the command.</li>
                <li>I have shortcuts like <code>cdprojx</code> which will jump me to my project directory, which is often on a separate partition or drive.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>E.g.</p>
            <pre><code>alias cdprojx="cd /media/data/projects/project X"</code></pre>
            <p>means that I only need to type <code>projx</code> to change to my "project X" working directory</p>

        <section>
            <head id="ping">Ping</head>
            <p>My wired ethernet connection is somewhat dodgy, this may have something to do with my aged tech, some sort of incompatibility or the power over ethernet adapters that I use.</p>
            <p>But let's not head down that rabbit hole. Mosty, I <code>ping</code> a public DNS to test that my connection is up.</p>
            <pre><code>$ ping 1.1.1.1</code></pre>
