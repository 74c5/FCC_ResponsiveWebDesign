# Projects: freeCodeCamp.org - Responsive Web Design Course</h1>

This repository lists contains the project portion of [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).

I've not attempted to create visually pleasing or publishable webpages, but rather simple projects that practice and demonstrate intended principles and fulfil the required automated rubric.
