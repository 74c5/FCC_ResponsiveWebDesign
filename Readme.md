# Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository lists contains the project portion of [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).

I've not attempted to create visually pleasing or publishable webpages, but rather simple projects that practice and demonstrate intended principles and fulfil the required automated rubric.  In fact, some of the design is deliberately ugly, dated, retro, etc - cuz it's fun, see?
